# TwoSum

NAME: Michelle Quach

DATE OF COMPLETION: September 9, 2020

PURPOSE OF LAB: Learn how to implement sorting an array and the interview question TwoSum (Find two numbers that equal the target value and return the indices of the solution)

METHOD USED: Use two pointers (one at the front of the array another at the end of the array). With a sorted array, find if two numbers equal the target value. If the numbers equal the target value, return the indices. If the numbers are less than the sum, try a value greater than the first (beginning). If the numbers are greater than the sum, try a value less than the first(end). If there is no solution or there are multiple answers due to duplicates, return [-1, -1].
